            Welcome to my blog.  My name is Garrett Stanifer and I am a student at IUPUI studying cybersecurity.  I am a second year student at IUPUI, but a first year cybersecurity student.  The majority of my study takes place in the classroom but I do try to learn some things outside of class.  I do this with tools like TryHackMe and YouTube that I feel really help me master some basic knowledge.

        <p>
            After having a subpar year in the Mechanical Engineering major, I decided to change to cybersecurity.
